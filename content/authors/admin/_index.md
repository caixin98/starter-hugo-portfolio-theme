I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2020. Currently, I am a Master’s student at [VIPL Group](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/), [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.cas.cn/) , supervised by [Prof. Shiguang Shan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Jiabei Zeng](https://dualplus.github.io/). I will start my Ph.D. at [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) in Fall 2023, supervised by [Prof. Tianfan Xue](https://tianfan.info/).
